# Neighborhood_week1

Introduction - The intent of this analysis is to identify perfect location with in the city to open a new restaurant. Since, there are already many restaurants in and around the city, it will be slightly difficult to find a location where the new restaurant can do good business. We have to keep few things in our mind before approaching towards the data analysis - 

1) How famous other restaurants are,
2) What cuisine/dishes they are famous for,
3) What is the average dine-in cost per person,
4) Distance between nearest competitor
5) Income of population of the locality 

Data - 

We will use the publicly available census data of Toronto for the year 2016 and Foursquare API to collect business competitors with the neighborhood location.
